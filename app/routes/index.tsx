        Honestly, how amazing is it to be able to write a whole full stack app all in JS, all in one project, even all
        in one file, add SSR to the mix and on top you have continous deployment in a one click setup? Web technology
        has come a long way and I like were this is going. (Full disclaimer: I also was over configuring webpack) This
        is the perfect setup for small projets for me right now.

        It seems most command line applications still look and feel like OG Vim. Because I am a strong proponent for
        useability and pleasing visuals, Warp filled a nieche in my work setup, I never really knew existed - and I am
        very happy about it. (It also comes with loads of options for customization!)

        For a long time I had a really hard time keeping up with current web development trends while working a 9 to 5
        as well. Then I noticed that I probably spend around 15h every just walking. (I have a dog) With the body motor
        functions occupied my mind seemed a lot sharper so I gave web dev podcasts a try and landed on Syntax. The two
        hosts have a great way of presenting complex topics in a digestable way and keeping it light - I highly
        recommend!

        I can't even say this enough how happy I am to have moved away from my good old mocca maker to a portafilter.
        After a small research I went for the BEEM ESPRESSO-GRIND-PROFESSION with intigrated grinder and milk frapper.
        It took me a couple of days tofigure the perfect setting out, but now my favourite oat milk flat white is served
        here at home.

        Working can be pretty hard when there is a lot of ambient noise distracting you, but I don't always want to play
        music on my head phones to get into the focus zone. Asoftmurmur is a simple age that let's you mix ambient
        sounds like rain or waves together for that soothing hyper focus soundtrack.

            After taking a little deture and getting my B.o.S. in landscape architecture in 2013 I decided for a career
            change, got an intership in a small agency and eventually completed my degree in media design. Prior to
            starting my studies in Berlin I had already created my first website in high school and from that moment
            onwards my interest developed into a real passion.

          <Typo.p>
            This particular background has shaped the way I am working today as a frontend engineer. I strive to develop
            applications that solve issues for their users without adding complexity to their workflows. For me this
            principle goes hand in hand with great usability and visul bla bla.
          </Typo.p>
          <Typo.p>
            Even though I consider myself mainly a frontend engineer, I recently have a growing interest in apllication
            architecture designand and am going more into a full stack direction as well. - If this sparks joy pop me a
