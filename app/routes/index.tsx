        Honestly, how amazing is it to be able to write a full stack app all in JS, all in one repo, even all in one
        file. And on top you have continous deployment in a one click setup on top of that? Web technology has come a
        long way and I like were this is going. (Full disclaimer: I also hated configuring webpack)

        It seems most command line apps still look and feel like OG Vim. Because I am a strong proponent for useability
        and pleasing visuals, Warp filled a nieche in my work setup, I never really knew existed - and I am very happy
        about it.(It also comes with loads of options for customization!)

        For a long time I had a really hard time keeping up with current web development trends while working a 9 to 5
        as well. Then I noticed that I probably spend around 15h a week on my daily walks with the dog. With the body
        motor functions occupied my mind seemed a lot sharper so I gave web dev podcasts a try and landed on Syntax. The
        two hosts have a great way of presenting complex topics in a digestable way and keeping it light - I highly
        recommend!

        I can't even say this enough how happy I am to move away from my good old mocca maker to a portafilter. After a
        small research I went for the BEEM ESPRESSO-GRIND-PROFESSION with intigrated grinder and milk frapper. It took
        me a couple of days tofigure the perfect setting out, but now my favourite oat milk flat white is served at
        home.

        Working can be pretty hard when there is a lot of ambient noise distracting you. I am easily distracted, but I
        don't always want to play music on my head phones to get into the focus zone. Asoftmurmur is a simple age that
        let's you mix ambient sounds like rain or waves into for that soothing hyper focus sound.

            After taking a little deture and getting my B.o.S. in landscape architecture I decided for a career change,
            got an intership and eventually completed my degree in media design. Back in 2006 I had created my first
            website during my web design courses in high school.
          </Typo.p>
          <Typo.p>
            This particular background has shaped the way I am working today as a frontend engineer. I strive to develop
            applications that solve tricky issues for their users and endeavour to make every product unique,
            aesthetically pleasing and usable for its specific target group.
          </Typo.p>
          <Typo.p>
            Even though I consider myself mainly a frontend engineer, i don't shy away from full-stacky tasks and am
            more and more interested in apllication architecture design as well. - If this sparks joy pop me a message{' '}
