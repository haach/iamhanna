        Honestly, how great is it to be able to write a whole "full stack" app, all in JS, with serverless functions,
        and continuous deployment in a one click setup? Web technology has come a long way and I like where it is going
        (full disclosure: I'd had enough of configuring webpack). This is definitely the setup I will be using for small
        projects from here on out.

        It seems most command line applications still look and feel like Vim. I am a strong proponent for usability and
        pleasing visuals, so Warp filled a niche in my work setup I never really knew was there. It has transformed my
        working experience; plus, Warp also comes with loads of options for customization!

        For a long time, I found it hard to keep up with current trends in web development while working a 9 to 5. I
        spend around 15h every week just walking, and having my motor functions occupied actually makes my mind a lot
        sharper. So, I gave web dev podcasts a try and eventually landed on Syntax. The two hosts have such a great way
        of presenting complex topics in a digestible way, and always keep it light and fun. I highly recommend!

        A set of hyper lightweight, fully tested, fully typed JS utility functions that should really already be part of

        I can't stress enough how happy I am to have retired my old espresso maker in exchange for a portafilter
        machine. After some research, I got the BEEM espresso machine that comes with an integrated grinder and a milk
        frother. It took me a couple of days to get the settings just right, but now my favorite oat milk flat white is
        served from right here at home.

        Working in a noisy environment, whether at home or in the office, is challanging. However, I don't always want
        to play music on my headphones to exclude the noise. Asoftmurmur offers a simple sulution: a webpage that allows
        you to mix ambient sounds, like rain or ocean waves, in order to create your ideal focus-zone soundtrack.
