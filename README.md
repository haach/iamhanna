## Tech stack

React on Remix and deployed to vercel. For my CSS I used Tailwind and some React Icons.

## Development

To run Remix locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
